# Work Report: Base Conversion Website

## Project Overview
In our Microprocessor course, my friend Arya Nadery and I, Daniel Keshavarz, developed a web application that converts numbers between different bases. This project allowed us to apply our knowledge of both back-end and front-end technologies effectively.

---

## Project Description
### Purpose
The primary goal of the project was to create a tool that facilitates the conversion of any number from one base to a destination base. This can be especially useful for students and professionals dealing with various numeral systems in computing.

### Technologies Used
- **Back-End:** Go (Golang)
- **Front-End:** JavaScript
- **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS

---

## Development Process

### 1. Planning
- **Research & Requirements Gathering:** We explored different numeral systems (binary, decimal, hexadecimal) and discussed the user experience for the application.
- **Architecture Design:** We outlined how the front-end will communicate with the back-end for the conversion process.

### 2. Implementation
#### Back-End (Golang)
- Developed a API to handle requests for base conversion.
- Implemented functions to convert various bases to decimal
- Implemented functions to convert decimal to various bases 
- Set up error handling to manage invalid inputs.

#### Front-End (JavaScript)
- Designed a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.
- Implemented calls to communicate with the back-end API

## Challenges Faced
- **Base Conversion Logic:** Ensuring accurate conversions between bases proved challenging. We had to account for edge cases and validate user inputs correctly.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Implementing calls required a good understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, which was initially confusing.

- **deployment process:** To deploy your code in Liara using Docker, just package your app into a Docker image and push it to Liara's container registry. With a simple command, your application will be live and ready to scale!

## Conclusion
This project not only enhanced our programming skills but also taught us the importance of collaboration and effective communication during the development process. We successfully created a functional website that serves as a base conversion tool, fulfilling the course requirements and providing a practical utility.

### Future Improvements
- Add more features, such as conversion history and support for additional numeral systems.
- Enhance UI with better styling and error messages to guide users.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to our instructor for guidance and our peers for their feedback during the various stages of the project.
